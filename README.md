# Change Converter

Given a number in pounds and pence, work out the most efficient way of breaking it down into notes and coins, e.g. 11.55 becomes ["£10", "£1", "50p", "5p"]

## Acceptance Criteria

```
change_generator.convert(7.42)
 => ["£5", "£1", "£1", "20p", "20p", "2p"]
change_generator.convert(40)
 => ["£20", "£20"]
change_generator.convert(16.30)
 => ["£10", "£5", "£1", "20p", "10p"]
change_generator.convert(19.99)
 => ["£10", "£5", "£1", "£1", "£1", "£1", "50p", "20p", "20p", "5p", "2p", "2p"]
change_generator.convert(76.81)
 => ["£50", "£20", "£5", "£1", "50p", "20p", "10p", "1p"]
```

## Notes

This is post Makers Academy where I returned to full-time employment and have limited time to code. I've given myself small coding challenges by completing TDD in Ruby from the Makers Academy process workshops challenges.
